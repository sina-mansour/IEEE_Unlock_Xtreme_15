---

This repository hosts the content used for the hands-on sessions of "Introduction to Python programmin" for the IEEE Unlock Xtreme series hosted by the IEEE student branch of The University of Melbourne.

We will cover the basics of computer programming and fundamental python syntax to write code.

Goals:

The main goal of this session is to learn the basics of Python programming. Namely, we'll explore data types, operators, data structures, conditional statements, loops, and functions.

The codes are provided in a format that can be directly executed in google colab, so there's no need for installing anything to start learning python.
